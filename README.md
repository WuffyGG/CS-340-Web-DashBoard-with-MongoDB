# CS-340-Web-DashBoard-with-MongoDB

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing classes, functions and comments. By separating code by classes, functions and comments, the code is easy to maintain and readable to anyone else.
The advantage of working this way is that you can find the mistakes and or errors in the program faster and also that other people can work on your code with you easier. I can use this CRUD Python module in the future with any
other database that may need to be worked on.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach a problem as a computer scientist by using my knowledge and skills and what the client is asking for to build a finished project. By working on the requirements and then testing those 
requirements you can reach a finished and working project. My approach differed from previopus assignemtns as I was working in MongoDB which is different from what I used in the past. This
required me to learn new skills which made the creating process a little bit more difficult. Techniques or strategies I would use in the future to create databases to meet other clients request would be
utilizing my knowledge to create these interfaces faster. Using my new knowledge it will take less time to make CRUD for any database that may need it.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve software development problems for clients who may not know how to do it themselves. This matters since people need web interfaces or softwares for their company and may not be able to make it themselves.
Work on this type of project helps Grazioso Salvare do their work better due to it being faster and more efficient to sift through the data now.
